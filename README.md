## Description
The AR-7 Camper III (alternatively written "Camper3") is the spiritual successor to the novel Armalite AR-7, Charter Arms AR-7, Charter Arms AR-7 Explorer II (Pistol), and the Henry AR-7 Survival Rifle, improving on the reciever design by adding some modern features.

The Camper III package includes the following:
- **Raw measurements for the AR-7** - Hand measured with calipers. Not a data package. Not for printing.
- **AR-7 - Legacy Reciever** - This print-ready model is based off the aesthetics a standard AR-7 reciever from Henry's production run from when they were in Brooklyn.
- **AR-7 Camper III - Reciever** - This print-ready model includes enhancements to the AR-7 reciever, such as 1913 brace/stock mount, top picatinny rails, gutter-sights in the picatinny, AR-15 grip compatibility, and reciever reinforcement for 3D printing or polymer-injection. The Camper III is NOT compatible with AR-7 storage stocks or other AR-7 accessories.

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each [x] you make.
- x1 **AR-7 Parts Kit** - Your parts kit should include all the necessary pins, hammer spring, magazine spring, and left-hand plate.

_WARNING_: While this reciever will accept rifle (top-notch) and pistol (bottom-notch) barrels, be sure to create a build compliant with your local laws. 

## Instructions
1. Print the desired reciever using the reccomended printing settings below.
2. Remove all supports from the model.
3. Begin by inserting the bolt assembly (bolt, twin recoil springs, recoil spring harness) into the reciever, with the extractor visible outwards on the right. Ensure bolt has free movement.
4. Insert the bolt handle into the bolt while it is in the reciever, at the takedown notch.
5. Gently release the bolt against the reciever.
6. Take the shared ejector/magazine release pin and pin it on the bottom left-most hole (towards the magwell).
7. Pulling the bolt back slightly, affix the ejector to the pin beginning with the ejector in the bolt path. Set the bolt forward.
8. Affix the magazine release, and insert the magazine release spring into the retention notch.
9. Affix the hammer assembly (hammer spring, hammer, and hammer retention pin) into the reciever.
10. Lift the arms of the hammer spring. Insert the trigger pivot pin into the hold- affix the trigger. Insert the hammer spring retention pin into the trigger. Let the arms of the hammer spring rest on the retention pin on the respective sides of the trigger.
11. Take the reciever plate, and align and insert it into the trigger pivot pin. (It won't catch on the hammer pin first- don't worry.) Do not force the plate into the hammer pin, but maintain pressure of the plate against the reciever.
12. Cock the bolt, then let as the bolt returns into battery, align the hammer spring into the reciever plate.
13. Snap reciever plate flush into the reciever. Use the reciever plate screw to secure the plate to the reciever.
14. Install the barrel.
15. Install other accessories or furniture respective to the model you printed.
16. Perform safety and function check. Beware not to dry-fire the gun too often, as it is a rimfire.
